    <p class="align-section text-size">What is the video card? its basically a expansion card that connects to the motherboard and its job is to display picture. Without a video card you will not be able to see on your moniter what you are doing. a lot of cpu's have already integrated graphics in them which means they have a gpu on them. but if you are going to do stuff like editing videos, or you want to play games on your pc. you most likely want to buy an external video card because the integrated gpu on the cpu is not strong enough to render the videos that is outputing. two major companies in which you will be looking for gpu are Nvidia and AMD. its important to do some research on video cards to find the ideal that will fit for your purpose. some are stronger than others and some might do better performance than others, for example most people that are editing clips or videos might want to look for something called CUDA cores. its good reference to look up other peoples build and see how do they perform and what is the limit it can render the video. </p>
