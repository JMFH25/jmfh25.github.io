    <p class="align-section text-size">The computer case is the outer part of the computer, kind of like the skin of the computer. it is also important to pick what case you would want because of a few things. first you need a good amount of space, which is great for cable management, second for good airflow which is necesarry for the components so the dont get to hot. also you need to get a case that is compatible with the motherboard. you dont want a mother board to be big and the case to be small. so check to make sure that the case that you have choosen is compatible with the motherboard that you have choosen. </p>
