    <p class="align-section text-size">So what is a CPU Fan? This component is basically what keeps the CPU cool. Without it the cpu will overheat and can damage your computer. <strong>THIS IS IMPORTANT: </strong>You need to apply thermal paste between the cpu and the cpu fan. Usually most cpu's come with their cpu fan and will have thermal paste already applied to it. But if you buy a retail cpu fan seperatly or want to buy a better fan than what it comes with it, you will definetly want to buy thermal paste to apply in the cpu fan.</p>
