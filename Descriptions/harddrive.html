    <p class="align-section text-size">So what is a harddrive, also known as HDD is a component that also stores data. This is the component that you will have you OS(operating system) installed and any other programs and documents. Unlike RAM which is volatile, HDD is non-Volatile which means even if you lose power on the computer you will not lose any saved data that you have. there are 3 types of HDD that are in the market. the first is standard HDD that we all know. the second one is called Solid state drive or SSD, these are much faster than the standard HDD because the comprise of no moving parts and that helps with the computer accesing data much quicker. the only downside of this is the cost, the more memory storage you get the more expensive it gets. alot of people tend to get both of them.</p>
